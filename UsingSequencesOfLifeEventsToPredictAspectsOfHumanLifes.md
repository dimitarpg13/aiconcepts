paper: [Using Sequences of Life-events to Predict Human Lives, German Savcisens et al, 2023](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/aiconcepts/blob/master/literature/DeepLearning/Using_Sequences_of_Life-events_to_Predict_Human_Lives_Savcisens_2023.pdf)

**//TODO:** add overview of the transformer-based approach for searching for relevant sequences 

**//TODO:** add dicusssion on the transformer-based identification of relevant sequences in the aggregation and inference of Semantic Structures with Semantic Simulation
