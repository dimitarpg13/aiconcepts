## Summary

This repository contains **work in progress** on the Theory of Semantic Structures. 

The purpose of the Theory of Semantic Structures is to provide a model which can be used for simulating human thought inferences and decision making processes. The semantic structures can be viewed as thought-like entities used in modeling the interactions and inferences of which are subject to study in this theory. A realistic model of the semantic structures interactions and creation of new structures will be used to study the evolution of the semantic structures in appropriately designed and tuned simulation environment. 

Semantic structures are abstract entitities which can be represented by directed graphs adorned with additional properties residing in appropriately defined metric space. Each node of the semantic directed graph represents a semantic particle which is represented by its position in semantic space. The metric of the semantic space is semantic distance. The closeness of semantic entities maps to the semantic closeness of thoughts which they model.

Additional properties with which each semantic particle is adorned is the semantic mass and semantic energy of the particle. Definition of semantic mass based on information content of a semantic particle is formulated. Each semantic particle is attracted or repelled by other semantic particles. Laws of attraction are postulated and a set of equations based on conservation of certain semantic quantities are derived which govern the formation and relative motion of structures in Semantic Space which govern the movement of structures in semantic space.
The equations of evolution of the semantic structures represent a process which depends on the initial conditions in more complex way than the evolution of Markov processes with hidden states. Important property of the semantic equations of evolution is the reversibility of the evolution of the system state i.e. we can find the state of the system at a moment `t_{j-1}` given the state of the system at moment `t_j`. 

Rules of reinforcement are postulated which strengthen the connections between closely related concepts and structures. Competing adversarial agents would modify the priorities on choosing inferences when acting on set of possible inferences. Special attention is paid to the concept of semantic inference and its implementation via the notion of semantic template structures.
