This repository contains work in progress on the theory of Semantic Structures. The theory of Semantic Structures models the aggregation and inference of entities which can be veiwed as thought-like.
The idea of semantic simulation that the interaction of semantic structures can be simulated via specially designed simulation environment. Laws of attraction are postulated and a set of equations are derived which govern the formation and relative motion of structures in Semantic Space. Rules of reinforcement are postulated which strengthen the connections between closely related concepts and structures. Competing adversarial agents decide the priorities on choosing inferences when acting on set of possible inferences. Special attention is paid to the concept of semantic inference and its implementation via the notion of semantic template structures.
