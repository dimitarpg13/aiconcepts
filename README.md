# Thought Forming, Consciousness, Intelligent Machines, Computability, Inference, Logic Systems
## Summary

This repository is a **work in progress**. 
It contains materials on [concepts, ideas, and mathematical tools](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/aiconcepts/blob/master/Resources.md) which _maybe_ relevant for the work in progress on [Theory of Semantic Structures](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/aiconcepts/tree/master/docs/SemanticStructures/README.md). 

## What's Next?

There are three topics in Semantic Structures which need to be completed as I feel those are of importance to the whole idea of semantic simulation by using a dynamical system. Those topics are:

1) Modeling of the aggregation of Semantic Structures via attractive / repulsive forces acting on the former and via their interaction with the semantic energy field:
The idea is to combine the effect of the semantic attractive / repulsive forces with the effect of the altered semantic energy field to guide the semantic ensembles entering the system toward their true semantic position. The important thing to recognize in order to make this mechanism work is that the semantic attractive and repulsive forces cause deviations in the ensemble trajectory on a smaller scale than the scale at which the altered semantic energy field acts over the ensemble trajectory. That is, the semantic attractive and repulsive forces will start affecting the trajectory of a semantic ensemble travelling toward its true semantic position only if it is close enough to the particles or structures which exert the aforementioned forces. That is, the semantic forces are local in nature while the alterations in the semantic energy field have global effect since semantic energy can be carried by the ensemble in semantic space. 
Need more work on the energy field based mechanism of guiding semantic structures toward their true semantic in-situ position.  
Need more work on the model of attraction / repulsion of semantic structures via semantic associations / disassociations. Need to clarify how this mechanism will work together with the energy field-based mechanism to synthesize the correct semantic structure after some evolution and how the newly formed semantic structure will eventually reach its true semantic in-situ position.

2) Completing the modeling of Semantic Inference via Semantic Templates:
We need to understand the meaning of the metric distance in Template Space â€“ what does it mean for two Template Structures to be close to each other in Template Space? Does it mean that regions in Semantic Space they are bound to will be close? Or it means that the kind of patterns they are going to recognize will be somewhat similar? How does the Inference Structures factor in the definition of a distance between two Semantic Templates? So the completion of the Semantic Template concept will depend on finding meaningful answers to these questions.

3) Elaborate on Reinforcement Learning applied to variety of _concepts_ in Semantic Space:

   a) for Semantic Energy: through alteration of the semantic energy field to find the true semantic in-situ positions of semantic structures.

   b) for Association / Disassociation Links, the mediators of the attractive/repulsive forces between particle ensembles in Semantic Space. Strengthening / weakening those should happen based on previously made connections and resulting inferences.

   c) for Semantic Templates: through modifying templates parameters, such as the bound region of the template, based on past inferences.

   d) for Semantic Templates: through modifying the laws of aggregation of Semantic Templates (need to work first on the laws of aggregation of the latter)
   
   _Hint_: cast each of those problems as online optimization problems which can be solved with appropriately chosen policy-based or value-based RL formalism.

There is a more advanced topic of research which I would like to gain better understanding. This is topic of _Hierarchical Semantic Template Spaces_.
