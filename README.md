This repository contains work in progress on the Theory of Semantic Structures. 

The purpose of the Theory of Semantic Structures is to provide a model which can be used for simulating human thought inference and decision making process. The semantic structures can be viewed as thought-like entities which interactions and inference are subject to analysis in this theory. A realistic model of the semantic structures interactions and creation of new structures will be used to study the evolution of the semantic structures in appropriately designed and tuned simulation environment. 

The closeness of semantic entities maps to the semantic closeness of thoughts which they model. Laws of attraction are postulated and a set of equations are derived which govern the formation and relative motion of structures in Semantic Space. Rules of reinforcement are postulated which strengthen the connections between closely related concepts and structures. Competing adversarial agents decide the priorities on choosing inferences when acting on set of possible inferences. Special attention is paid to the concept of semantic inference and its implementation via the notion of semantic template structures.
