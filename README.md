This repository contains work in progress on various AI concepts which can be modeled via semantic simulation.
The idea of semantic simulation considers various semantic structures and concepts and assumes that their interactions can be simulated via specially designed simulation environment. Laws of attraction are postulated and a set of equations are derived which govern the formation and relative motion of structures in Semantic Space. Rules of reinforcement are postulated which strengthen the connections between closely related concepts and structures. Competing adversarial agents decide the priorities on choosing inferences when acting on set of possible inferences. Special attention is paid to the concept of semantic inference and its implementation via the notion of semantic template structures.
