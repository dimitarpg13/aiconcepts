This repository contains work in progress on various AI concepts which can be modeled via semantic simulation.
The idea of semantic simulation considers various semantic structures and concepts and assumes that their interactions can be simulated via specially designed simulation environment. Rules of reinforcement will strengthen the connections between closely related concepts and structures and the competition of adversarial agents will decide the priorities when acting on inferences. Special attention is paid on the concept of semantic inference and its implementation via the semantic template structures.
