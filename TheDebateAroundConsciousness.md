# The Ongoing Debate Around Consciousness - Are we capable of creating conscious machines


The viewpoint of Roger Penrose that consciousness is quantum phenomenon and a bi-product of the way Quantum Mechanics works:

_Summary_: microtubules are responsible for consciousness. More precisiely, The 'Orch OR' theory attributes consciousness to quantum computations in microtubules inside brain neurons. Quantum computers process information as superpositions of multiple possibilities which, in Orch OR, are alternative collective dipole oscillations orchestrated by microtubules.

Another sceptic, J. Mark Bishop and his article "Artificial Intelligence is Stupid and Causal Reasoning will not fix it" [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.513474/full). 
The viewpoint of the author can be summarized by the statement made by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis:

_“we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets—often using an approach known as ‘Deep Learning’—and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality.”_

In this article the author invokes R. Penrose's arguments as well.
