# The Ongoing Debate Around Consciousness - Are we capable of creating conscious machines


The viewpoint of **Roger Penrose** that consciousness is quantum phenomenon and a bi-product of the way Quantum Mechanics works:

**Stuart Hameroff**'s biological insights relate to Roger Penrose's stipulations that Consciousness is quantum phenomenon. More on Stuart Hameroff' take on Consciousness and what is causing it: links [here](https://youtu.be/nJssLyvqG9o), [here](https://youtu.be/tkECK3RzEPM) and [here](https://youtu.be/Q6gpp70yvgo)

_Summary_: microtubules are responsible for consciousness. More precisiely, The **Orch OR** theory attributes consciousness to quantum computations in microtubules inside brain neurons. Quantum computers process information as superpositions of multiple possibilities which, in **Orch OR**, are alternative collective dipole oscillations orchestrated by microtubules. Consciousness is a process on the finest scale of the Universe. He retells Roger Penrose's viewpoint that Consciousness is caused by the spontaneous collapse of wave function on quantum level. "_Consciousness is not computational. There is something else than Turing machine going on in our brains_", _"If everthing is Algorithmic in our brain we are like zombies on autopilot, or like AI"_.

The idea of Stuart Hameroff that microtubules are at the root of the phenomenon of Consciousness was dicussed for first time in his 1987 book _"Ultimate Computing: Biomolecular Consciousness and NanoTechnology"_ which can be found [here](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/aiconcepts/blob/master/literature/QuantumCognition/ULTIMATE_COMPUTING_Biomolecular_Consciousness_and_NanoTechnology_Hameroff_1987.pdf)

And here is the retort by Dr Laura McKemmish to this idea - [_"Penrose-Hameroff orchestrated objective-reduction proposal for human consciousness
is not biologically feasible, 2009"_](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/aiconcepts/blob/master/literature/QuantumCognition/Penrose-Hameroff_orchestrated_objective-reduction_proposal_for_human_consciousness_is_not_biologically_feasible_Laura_McKemmish.pdf)

Another sceptic, **J. Mark Bishop** expresses his view in his article _"Artificial Intelligence is Stupid and Causal Reasoning will not fix it"_ [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.513474/full). 
The viewpoint of the author can be summarized by the statement made by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis:

_“we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets—often using an approach known as ‘Deep Learning’—and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality.”_

In this article the author invokes R. Penrose's arguments as well.
